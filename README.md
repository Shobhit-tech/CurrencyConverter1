#Dynamic Currency Converter (Personal Project) :

● Developed a single-page currency converter application using HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript.
● Integrated a live Exchange Rate API to fetch real-time conversion data, managing asynchronous data requests using JavaScript
Promises.
● Implemented a secondary Flags API that dynamically updates country flags to match the selected currency codes (e.g., USD, INR,
NPR).
● Using fontawesome library to make project more user friendly
● Used JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation to create an interactive experience, allowing users to input an amount, select
currencies, and see the calculated result on a button click.
● Styled the application with CSS to create a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
